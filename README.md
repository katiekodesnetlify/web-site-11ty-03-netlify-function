Here's some boilerplate so you can focus on building Netlify Functions.

1. Build a Netlify site out of this repo.
2. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/` -- there should be static content visible.
3. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/helloWorld` -- it should greet you with "Hello World."
4. Go to `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/helloWorld?name=FirstName` -- it should greet you with "Hello FirstName."
5. Experiment with actually writing functions -- have fun.
